# Mentor Token

**Mentor Token** is a **responsive full-stack web application** designed to help **startups find experienced mentors** and give **mentors the opportunity to discover and apply to jobs** that match their expertise.

The main goal of the application is to create a **simple and user-friendly platform** where both sides can interact ‚Äî startups can post job offers, and mentors can apply. Startups can then review applications and either accept or reject them.

This project helped me **practice and improve my full-stack development skills** using modern web technologies.
